# Number-Plate-Recognition-using-DL-and-OCR
Trying out a deep learning model and a computer vision technique that detects the license plates and then the Optical Character Recognition model extracts the relevant characters from it to be able for us to recognize the registration number on any number plate images.

The project essentially is split up into two stages: detection and recognition, where the Detection stage is further split up into two different implementations:
1. Detection using the Canny Edge Detector
2. Detection using the pre-trained deep learning model, Haarcascade Classifier, where the detection was carried out in real-time using the PC web-cam.

The Recognition Stage is performed using the EasyOCR technique, and all the relevant code files and processed images folder is provided.
